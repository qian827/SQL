In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1 How many orders were placed in January?
Select Count(orderID) From BIT_DB.JanSales;


#2 How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
Select count (orderID) From BIT_DB.JanSales Where Product='iPhone';


#3 Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
Select acctnum 
From BIT_DB.customers
Inner join BIT_DB.FebSales
On BIT_DB.customers.order_id=BIT_DB.FebSales.orderID;

#4 Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
Select distinct Product,Min(price) 
From BIT_DB.JanSales
Group by Product, price
Order by price Asc Limit 1;

#5 What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? (Revenue can be calculated using the number of products sold and the price of the products).
Select Product, Sum(quantity*price) as revenue
From BIT_DB.JanSales
Group by Product;

#6 Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
Select Product,sum(Quantity),Sum(quantity*price) as revenue
From BIT_DB.FebSales
Where location='548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
Group by Product;

#7 How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
Select count(acctnum),avg(quantity*price)
From BIT_DB.FebSales
Left join BIT_DB.customers
On FebSales.orderID=customers.order_id
Where FebSales.Quantity >2;
